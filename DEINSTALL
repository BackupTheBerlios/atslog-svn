The deinstallation of ATSlog. Step by step instruction:

1. Stop ATSlog

   atslogmaster stop 

2. Change directory to the value of the $sharedir parameter from the
   configuration file (by default it is a directory /usr/local/share/atslog)
   and run the command:

   make deinstall

   During the deinstallation a script will check up if there are files with
   work information not to delete anything you need.

3. The text log-files will not be deleted (everything that is in the catalog
   described by the parameter $logdir of the configuration file: by default
   it is a directory /var/log/atslog ). Any directories that have any files
   that are not connected with ATSlog will not be deleted.

   The dats stored in the SQL server tables, will not be deleted.

   Please, pay attention that during the deinstallation of the program
   PID-file ( /var/run/atslogd.pid ) will not be deleted.
