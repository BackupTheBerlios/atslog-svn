API for the atslogd binary PBX modules.

1. Why we need this?

Some PBX vendors are using 2way duplex protocols for the PBX exchange.
Also, some PBX vendors use binary data formats which cannot be parsed 
with regular expressions. This API allow to extend atslog features to support
such hardware. If your PBX use normal string oriented SMDR - you dont need
this.

2. Implementation

If you want to support such SMDR you need to create "plugin" which contain

function ReadPBXStream(hCom,). 

3. Code Sample

see plugins/dummy.c file.
