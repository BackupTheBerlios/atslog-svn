2.0.0 Release plans:
Add postgressql support to the installer.
Proofread translation of the english web interface

2.1.x plans
* daemon - make fast_write mode more reliable (we need to control atslogdb.pl 
  state), we need to be sure that data was transferred to sql, etc...
  Good idea is to use "tail" mode for the log files
* add accounting code (AKA business code) support to the upcoming 2.1
* Replace http-header based auth with form-based one. This will allow to 
  run atslog-www with php-cgi and to implement "logout" function.

May be, someday
* accounting (billing)
* smarty-based templates
