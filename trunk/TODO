Nearest plans:
* daemon - make fast_write mode more reliable (we need to control atslogdb.pl 
  state)
* make stable 2.0.0 release (uhh)
* add accounting code (AKA business code) support to the upcoming 2.1
* FreeBSD port in the freebsd ports tree

May be, someday
* accounting
* smarty-based templates
