2.2.x plans
* add accounting code (AKA business code) support
* Replace http-header based auth with form-based one. This will allow to 
  run atslog-www with php-cgi and to implement "logout" function.
* Add support for the >1 PBX to the atslog.

May be, someday
* accounting (billing)
* smarty-based templates
