# The password for the user $sqlmasteruser
# Server ATSlog programs on behalf of this user initialize all references to
# SQL server for modifications in databases.
# Example:
# sqlmaspasswd=Edktxtybt

sqlmaspasswd=

# Other SQL server settings
#
sqlhost=localhost
sqldatabase=atslog
sqlmasteruser=atslog

# SQL Server type
# Currently MySQL and PostgreSQL are supported.
# Example:
# sqltype=MySQL
# sqltype=PostgreSQL
#
sqltype=MySQL

# COMMUNICATION PORT SETTINGS

# Port for connection with PBX.
# It is possible to use two kinds of connection:
# 1. Through a serial port. In this case the program will use port as device
# named /dev/$port.
# In the configuration file the prefix "/dev/" falls.
#    E.g:
# BSD
#    port=cuaa0
# Linux
#    port=ttyS0
# 2. Via TCP/IP port.
#    The demon will open a TCP socket and will expect connection on
#    specified number of port.
#    It is necessary to specify a prefix tcp:port_number
# Sample:
#    port=tcp:1234
#
port=cuaa0

# Speed of the server serial port $port
# Speed should correspond to adjustments of speed of the
# automatic telephone exchange port.
# Valid values:
# speed=2400
# speed=4800
# speed=9600
# speed=19200
# speed=38400
# speed=57600
# speed=115200
#
speed=9600

# length of character on serial port
# valid values from 5 to 8
charsize=8

# parity of serial port
# Valid values:
# parity=e  (even parity)
# parity=o  (odd parity)
# parity=n  (no parity)
#
parity=n

# number of stop bits on serial port;
# Valid values:
# stopbits=1
# stopbits=2

# ASCII log file in which script writes down calls from the PBX

# File with lines, the information from which has not been transferred from 
# text log to a database. As a rule, it is lines containing the information 
# not concerning calls. For example, headings of columns explanatories. 
# This file is stored in a folder described in parameter $logdir and submits to
# rules of rotation. For the additional information see the description 
# of $howmonth and $debug parameters.
#
notwritelog=notwrite.log

# Whether to write out record to the $notwritelog file or not. 
# Record of this log is used, basically, for debugging. It is convenient to 
# trace those data, which have not been processed by the module of analysis of
# lines. Earlier the parameter $debug referred to $nowrlog. 
# It has been renamed for the best understanding of value.
#
# Valid values:
# debug=yes
# debug=no
#

# In it this log file you can find records about startup, shutdown, errors and
# other event. File is stored in a folder described in parameter $logdir and

# PBX model.
# PBX`s supported by current version of the ATSLog:
# Panasonic KX-TA308RU
#           KX-TA308
#           KX-TA616RU
#           KX-TD1232
#	    KX-TD816RU
#	    KX-TD500
# Samsung   SKP-816
#           NX-820
# Hybrex    GD-320
# Siemens   HICOM-350H
#           HICOM-250
# LG        GDK-100
#           GDK-162
#           GHX-46
#           LDK-300
#           LDK-100
# GoldStar  GPS-6A
# Alcatel   4200E
#
# At the $model parameter it is necessary to set only a designation of PBX model
# without the name of the manufacturer. 
# it is necessary to specify precisely marks of model since adapted models
# will distinguish a format of date; for example for KX-TA616RU date 
# are in DD/MM/YY format, instead of how in native - MM/DD/YY for KX-TA616
# models.
# Example:
# model=KX-TA616RU
#
model=KX-TA616RU

# syslogd level
# syslogd used for critical error messsages.
# refer to man logger(1), syslog.conf(5) for the additional information
#
syslogfacility=user.err

# Direct recording from PBX to SQL server.
# With "no" value calls are transfered to the text log file ($curcallslogfile),
# and then, daily, to the SQL server.
# Value "yes" on this parameter will tranfer call information directly to SQL
# at the call time.
# Data is stored in the text log file ($callslogfile) in any case.
# "yes" setting will switch atslog to daemon mode and will use Perl permanently,
# so it will use more hardware resources.
#
# Possible values:
# fastwrite=no
# fastwrite=yes
#
fastwrite=yes

# End of configuration file...  Have a nice day!
