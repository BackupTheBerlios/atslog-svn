If you upgrading from previous versions of the ATSLog or Panalog please read
UPDATING file

Installation. The step-by-step instruction. 

2.1 Download and unpack atslog-2.0.0pre4.tar.gz:
    fetch http://atslog.dp.ua/download/archives/atslog-2.0.0pre4.tar.gz
    tar vzxfmp atslog-2.0.0pre4.tar.gz

2.2 Look at the "configure" options:
    cd atslog-2.0.0pre4
    ./configure --help
	and run "configure" with your settings

2.3 Run "make install"

2.4 Adjust settings in the
    $PREFIX/atslog.conf  (e.g. /usr/local/etc/atslog.conf) file.

    Pay special attention on such parameters as:
      $port
      $speed
      $fastwrite
      $model

2.5 Run your SQL server (PostgreSQL or MySQL).

2.6.1 If you are using MySQL:

    If you already have a version of ATSlog on your system, you have to 
    decide if you want to keep the information which is in the database 
    at the moment. If you don't want to keep it, drop the database. 
    Only do this if you don't want to keep the information currently in your 
    squidalyser database. You need to know the name of the database ("atslog"
    by default), the MySQL admin user (usually "root") and the admin password:

    $ mysql -u  <admin_username> -p
    Enter password:
    drop database <dbname>;
    exit

    Than, you need to create the database; then grant the appropriate 
    permissions to the database user; and finally create the database tables 
    and the information contained in them. The "logfile" table contains a 
    few entries for testing purposes, which can be deleted after testing.
    
    $ mysql -u <admin_username> -p
      Enter password:

      create database <dbname>;

      /* "atslog" is the suggested dbname.  */

      grant all on <dbname>.* to <dbuser>@localhost identified by '<dbpass>';
     
      /* "atslog" is the suggested dbuser. Make up your own password :-)  */

      flush privileges;
      exit

     When you've done that, create the tables and insert the information they contain:
 
     mysql <dbname> -u <admin_username> -p < sql/createsqltables.mysql.sql
     mysql <dbname> -u <admin_username> -p < sql/data.sql

2.6.2 If you are using PostgresSQL: 
     TODO.
