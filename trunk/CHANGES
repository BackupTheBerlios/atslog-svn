# (samm) fixed rtcp mode. Now if PBX was disconnected for some reason (e.g.
         remote PBX reboot, or network failure) atslogd will try to connect
         untill success(with reconnection timeout).

         files

# (samm) SECURITY: replace conf.inc with conf.inc.php
# (samm) Replase DELETE FROM calls with TRUNCATE TABLE calls. Truncate has the
         same effect as an unqualified DELETE but since it does not actually
          scan the table it is faster. This is most effective on large tables.
