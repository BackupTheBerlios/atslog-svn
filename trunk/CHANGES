# (samm) fixed bug #009819 - atslogd hangs in tcp mode if port is busy

# (samm) fixed bug with stale pid file if atslogd exit on failure.
# (samm) Fixed bug in www with sending http auth header if db connection fail
! (samm) INSTALL file updated
+ (samm) Added support for the Siemens HiPath 3000/3750
# (samm) External Mobile codes support was broken at pre3. Thanks to
         Alexander Logvinov for the report.
+ (samm) Added support for the PANASONIC KX-TD1232 with Russian Firmware
! (samm) Directory structure was changed. 
+ (samm) new Perl SQL installer. Currently work only with MySQL but will
         support PostgresSQL at 2.0.0 release. 
+ (samm) new GNU autoconf based configure script. I hope this will make 
         install process easer and more portable.
# (samm) when atslogd was not in daemon mode (default!) we had 0 in the 
         PID file
# (samm) gpid replaced with pid. We have only one process, so we dont
         really need gpid.
+ (samm) Now library names are not hardcoded into atslogdb.pl
         This allow user to add new library easer.
+ (samm) Added support for the Panasonic KX-TD500 PBX (tested by Ivan Frolov) 

2006-DEC-15: New atslog-2.0-pre3 stable snapshot released

+ (hiddenman) Added new ukrainian mobile operator codes
+ (samm) Added possibility to redefine mobile operator codes in the 
         configuration file.
# (samm) Fixed filter query bug. On query with 'exclude city calls' AND
         'exclude cellular calls' result was incorrect. Filter fixed.
# (samm) now atslogd set CLOCAL flag on serial device before opening 
         in blocking mode. This is fix for hanging on Linux with /dev/ttySx
         devices. Also now atslogd restore tty settings on exit.
# (samm) fixed rtcp mode. Now if PBX was disconnected for some reason (e.g.
         remote PBX reboot, or network failure) atslogd will try to connect
         untill success(with reconnection timeout).
# (samm) "parcecullcalls()" sub removed from the librarys body,  because 
         we already have this sub in the atslogdb.pl
# (samm) Corrected names of the text logs (russian letters was used!)
# (samm) html fixes catched by validator.w3.org (typos, errors, etc.)
# (samm) fixed many problems with unset variables and other errors reported 
         by PHP engine. I hope this will allow to run atslog-www without many
         errors in the log file.
# (samm) adoddb updates to latest version to fix minor problems with php
# (samm) delete UTF8 locale untill fixing unicode related bugs (tr() calls,
         etc.)
# (samm) Quick and dirty english translation of the INSTALL and configuration
         files
# (samm) replace <? with <?php in php scripts
# (samm) SECURITY: replace conf.inc with conf.inc.php
# (samm) Replase DELETE FROM calls with TRUNCATE TABLE calls. Truncate has the
         same effect as an unqualified DELETE but since it does not actually
          scan the table it is faster. This is most effective on large tables.
+ (samm) Added support for the Alcatel 4200E PBX
# (samm) Fix for the mysql>5.0.3 - decimal size was changed
# (samm) phplot updated to 5.0RC3 (fix problem with PHP5)

         with idle timeout.
