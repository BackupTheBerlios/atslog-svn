===========================================

This is a PHP search engine.  It searches for text
and then displays results. At the time I completed it
it was the first of its kind.  I spent many hours
looking for something like it, but could not find
anything. It searches the directory you put it in.

Files Required:

NEWSEARCH.PHP
sas.gif   , The sasquatch logo.

How to use this:

I use a form,  to submit to it.
The form html is below:

<form method="POST" action="NEWSEARCH.php"> 
Search our site: 
<input type="text" name="whatdoreplace" size="20"> 
<input type="submit" value="Search" name="B1"> 
</FORM>

BTW - Please keep this file with the script if you distribute it. 
I am not responsible for anything bad that happens due to the
 downloading, viewing, or use of these files.  If your mess up
 the code and instaed of searching it erases your hard drive,
 that would be your fault.  The code works perfect when published.
