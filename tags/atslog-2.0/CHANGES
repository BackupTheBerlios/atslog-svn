# - Bug fixed
+ - Feature added


=== ATSLOG 2.0-DEV ===
# (samm) Fixed filter query bug. On query with 'exclude city calls' AND
         'exclude cellular calls' result was incorrect. Filter fixed.
# (samm) now atslogd set CLOCAL flag on serial device before opening 
         in blocking mode. This is fix for hanging on Linux with /dev/ttySx
         devices. Also now atslogd restore tty settings on exit.
# (samm) fixed rtcp mode. Now if PBX was disconnected for some reason (e.g.
         remote PBX reboot, or network failure) atslogd will try to connect
         untill success(with reconnection timeout).
# (samm) "parcecullcalls()" sub removed from the librarys body,  because 
         we already have this sub in the atslogdb.pl
# (samm) Corrected names of the text logs (russian letters was used!)
# (samm) html fixes catched by validator.w3.org (typos, errors, etc.)
# (samm) fixed many problems with unset variables and other errors reported 
         by PHP engine. I hope this will allow to run atslog-www without many
         errors in the log file.
# (samm) adoddb updates to latest version to fix minor problems with php
# (samm) delete UTF8 locale untill fixing unicode related bugs (tr() calls,
         etc.)
# (samm) Quick and dirty english translation of the INSTALL and configuration
         files
# (samm) replace <? with <?php in php scripts
# (samm) SECURITY: replace conf.inc with conf.inc.php
# (samm) Replase DELETE FROM calls with TRUNCATE TABLE calls. Truncate has the
         same effect as an unqualified DELETE but since it does not actually
          scan the table it is faster. This is most effective on large tables.
+ (samm) Added support for the Alcatel 4200E PBX
# (samm) Fix for the mysql>5.0.3 - decimal size was changed
# (samm) phplot updated to 5.0RC3 (fix problem with PHP5)
+ (samm) Add auto_reconnect for the MySQL connection. This will fix a problem
         with idle timeout.
# (hiddenman) We souldn't daemonize without options
# (hiddenman) Fixed tcp/rtcp parsing (thanks Oleg Karpov for reporting)

! (hiddenman) Siemens HICOM-250 supoort
