Nearest plans:
* daemon - make fast_write mode more reliable (we need to control atslogdb.pl 
  state), we need to be sure that data was transferred to sql, etc...
* make stable 2.0.0 release (uhh)
* FreeBSD port in the freebsd ports tree
* Checking of the php-pcre, mysql and (optional) gd extension.
* add accounting code (AKA business code) support to the upcoming 2.1
* Replace http-header based auth with form-based one. This will allow to 
  run atslog-www with php-cgi and to implement "logout" function.

May be, someday
* accounting
* smarty-based templates
