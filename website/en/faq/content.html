<ul>
<li><b>ATSlog works, but the text log file if being filled with some garbage instead of lines with call descriptions. What is the reason?</b></li>
<i>Possible reason:</i><br>
<ul>
<li>The PBX port and computer port rates mismatch.</li>
</ul>
<i>Solution:</i><br>
<ul>
<li>
Change the parameter <tt>$speed</tt> in the config file <tt>/usr/local/etc/atslog.conf</tt>
Look up also for other port settings: <tt>$charsize, $parity, $stopbits</tt>.
Port parameters can be taken from the documentation to the PBX.
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<li><b>When writing from the text log file into server SQL database the program issues the following warning:</b>
<br><tt>Warning! No entries from the log file were parsed to the SQL server. This might has been caused by an error.</tt></li>
<i>Possible reasons:</i>
<ul>
<li>Wrong PBX model in the $model parameter of the config file.
<li>It is also possible that the log file contains no lines with the PBX data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<br>
<li><b>How can I import data from the previously generated text log file into ATSlog?</b></li>
<i>Solution:</i>
<ul>
<li>Copy the data into the file <tt>/var/log/atslog/calls.log</tt> (the default file; particularly check the value of the parameter <tt>$callslogfile</tt> of the config file <tt>/usr/local/etc/atslog.conf</tt>)</li>
<li>Use the function of writing all calls into the server SQL database: 
<pre>
# atslogmaster alltodb
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<li><b>ATSlog starts, but nothing happens, the data from PBX are not being writen. In the process list two atslogd daemons are present.</b></li>
<i>Possible reason:</i>
<ul>
<li>There is no connection between the daemon and the PBX.</li>
</ul>
<i>Solution:</i>
<ul>
<li>Check the parameter <tt>$port</tt> of the config file  <tt>/usr/local/etc/atslog.conf</tt> and check the plugging of the cable from PBX to the PC. Lack of connection can also be caused by a wrong cable pin-out.</li>
</ul><br>
<li><b>Upon installation with the use of the MySQL server on another PC other than localhost, the ATSlog issues the following message:</b>
<pre>
ERROR 1130: Host 'atslog.server.com' is not allowed to connect to this MySQL server.
</pre>
<b>Or:</b>
<pre>
ERROR 1045: Access denied for user: 'root@atslog.server.com' (Using password: YES)
</pre>
<b>As a result, ATSlog fails to install/update.</b></li>


<br><i>Possible reason:</i>
<ul>
<li>For ATSlog operation it is necessary to insert the data into MySQL under the superuser permissions. By default the root access is possible only from the localhost. </li>
</ul>
<i>Solution:</i>
<ul>
<li>Temporarily enlarge the superuser rights for accessing from the host 'atslog.server.com'. The command is:
<pre>
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO "root"@"atslog.server.com" IDENTIFIED
BY 'noncrypted_root_password' WITH GRANT OPTION;
</pre>
Thereafter the installation can be resumed<br>
After installing dont forget to restore back the permissions of the root: <br>
<pre>
DELETE FROM mysql.user WHERE User = "root" AND Host = "atslog.server.com";
DELETE FROM mysql.db WHERE User = "root" AND Host = "atslog.server.com";
DELETE FROM mysql.tables_priv WHERE User = "root" AND Host = "atslog.server.com";
DELETE FROM mysql.columns_priv WHERE User = "root" AND Host = "atslog.server.com";

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
</pre></li>
</ul>
</ul>
