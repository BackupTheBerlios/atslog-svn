<div class="header">About the Software</div>
<h3><a name="about4"></a>Program Aims and Goals</h3>

<p>The ATSlog software provides a handy web-oriented interface for viewing and analysing calls for various types of PBX (Private Branch eXchange) models. The program is GNUWare, distributed under the 
 <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html" target="_blank">GPL</a> license, and is completely open-source.
<br>
At present the program operates successfully with 
Panasonic, Samsung, 
Hybrex, Siemens, LG, and  Alcatel PBX models. If your particular type of PBX 
is not supported yet, we can add this functionality.  Please claim for additional functionalities using either Forum or Support links.
</p>
<p>It is the author's pleasure to express his deepest gratitude towards the developpers who have contributed to the software support and development. See the <a href="/about/#about2">For Developpers</a> section.</p>

</ul>
<h3><a name="about3"></a>Nearest future</h3>
<p>To-Do list:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Billing</li>
  <li>English translation.</li>
  <li>Add SQLite support, which allows operating without SQL server.</li>  
  <li>Setting time intervals (not only the dates) in the web interface.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="about1"></a>Improvement and develoment of the program</h3>
<p>The author of the ATSlog software enjoys working under its development, therefore he is ready to help adapting it to novel PBX models and porting to other operating systems. From your part it will be enough just to send us the text log files. You will find <a href="http://www.01.dp.ua/connect/" target="_blank">here</a> how to contact the author.</p>
<h3><a name="about2"></a>For developpers</h3>
<p>Dear Colleagues! If you want to share your own artworks
based on the ATSlog software, the author will greatly appreciate the possibility 
of acquainting with them and providing them for the wide public access.
The ATSlog program needs further development and adaptation. If you are ready to participate, look into the <b>&lt;</b><a href="/forum/">Forum</a>&gt; section.</p>
