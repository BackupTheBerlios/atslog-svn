with such models as Panasonic KX-TA308, KX-TA308RU, KX-TA616RU, KX-TD816RU,
KX-TD1232; Samsung SKP-816.
If you want to put into the register of supported by PBX another model, you
should look to the division <b>&lt;</b><a href="/en/about/#about1">The upgrading
and extension of the program</a><b>&gt;</b>.
</p>
<p>An author will be thankful to the programmer, who will help the development
of the program. The information is in division

<h3><a name="about5"></a>The abilities of ATSlog</h3>
<ol>
    <li>A comfortable web-interface for access to the statistics:
	<ul>
	    <li>Flexible mode of the task of a range of dates.</li>
    	    <li>An opportunity to analyze the information from two sides&nbsp;&#151;

	    <li>A color painting for different types of calls. 
	    <li>A sorting by the head-lines of the columns of the table (direct and
indirect order).
	    <li>Before printing preparing.
	    <li>Cashing of the SQL asks, which allows quicker working on the information.

<h3><a name="about6"></a>The model of the program</h3>
<ul>
  <li>For work you need: SH, Perl 5.X, PHP 4.X. Everything was tested on the base of Apache server 1.3.X</li>
  <li>The program wokr on *NIX platforms: FreeBSD, Linux; The porting under other POSIX systems is possible.</li>
  <li>To work the module atslogd is used for reading  the information from ATS,
  perl script is used for writing in the data base, PHP and any http server is
  used for access to the statistics throughout  the web-interface.</li>
  <li>ATSlog is easily used and tuned.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="about3"></a>The nearest plans of developing</h3>
<p>The list of things that should be done:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The translating of the documentation into English.</li>
  <li>The showing of the time diapason in web-interface.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="about1"></a>The upgrading and widening of the program</h3>
<p>The author of ATSlog works on the program with pleasure and interest and
that is why He is ready to help in it's adaptation to new models of ATS and
